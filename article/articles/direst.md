# Dire Straits
## New version
Dire Straits formed in London in 1977 by Mark Knopfler, David Knopfler, John Illsley and Pick WithersThey were active from 1977 to 1995. Dire Straits' sound drew from various influences, including country, folk, the blues rock and jazz. Their stripped-down sound contrasted with punk rock and demonstrated a roots rock influence that emerged from pub rock. Dire Straits were called "the biggest British rock band of the 80s" by Classic Rock magazine.

## Brothers in Arms
Brothers in Arms was the first album recorded entirely digitally, because of Knopfler pushing for improved sound quality.
